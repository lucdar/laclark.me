Hello! I'm Lucas Clark. I'm a recent graduate from UC Berkeley where I studied
Computer Science and Music. I'm fascinated by the relationship people have with
technology, and I enjoy thinking about ways that I can simplify, ease, or
otherwise improve it.

# Education

I graduated from University of California, Berkeley with two degrees: a B.A. in
Computer Science form the College of Computing, Data Science, and Society; and
a B.A. in Music from the College of Letters and Sciences. In High School, I was
torn between whether I should study Music or Computer Science; I enjoyed and did
well in my Computer Science classes, but Music is what I was passionnate about.
I wasn't super excited to apply to UC Berkeley at first (they were just another
box I checked on my UC application). Though, when I recieved my acceptance
letter, I did some research and realized I could double major!

My first semester at UC Bereley was in Fall 2020 -- the middle of the COVID-19
Pandemic!
